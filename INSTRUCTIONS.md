In this lab, you will sort an array of constant integers in place using three different techniques.

1. reset() will be used to set the array to the origional numbers

2. displayIntArray() will be used to printout the contents of the sorted array

3. displayPtrArray() will be used to printout the pointer addresses of each of the elements of the pointer array. This must be done before and after the each sort is done (no text should be displayed in this function)

4. BubbleSort() will be called which will use the bubble sort techinque to sort the contents of the pointer array such that when you iterate through the array and print out its content, the integers will be in ascending sorted order
Everytime you change the content of the elements of the pointer array, print out the entire pointer array by calling the void displayPtrArrayDeref  function.  But only display the contents when the elements in the aray have changed.

5. SelectionSort() will be called which will use the selection sort technique to sort the content of the pointer array such that when you iterate through the array and print out its content, the integers will be in ascending sorted order
Everytime you change the content of the elements of the pointer array, print out the entire pointer array by calling 
    Note: Code for function is given

6. InsertionSort() will be called which will use the insertion sort technique to sort the content of the pointer array such that when you iterate through the array and print out its content, the integers will be in ascending sorted order.
Everytime you change the content of the elements of the pointer array, print out the entire pointer array by calling the void displayPtrArrayDeref  function.  But only display the contents when the elements in the aray have changed.

7. The last line will contain the phrase "Sorting Complete and your name
